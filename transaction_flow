Transaction Flow: 

The transaction flow is as follows:

Fetch the contract and the shipment for which this transaction is being called upon.

Calculate the total payout by multiplying the unit price with the unit cost.

Update the shipment status to “Arrived”.

If the shipment is late as per the contract, set the payout to 0.

Map the contract temperature and acceleration values with the asset recorded temperature 
and acceleration values.

Calculate the penalty factor for temperature and acceleration values. 

A sample penalty factor could be 
(contract minimum temperature - lowest reading on asset) * the penalty factor detailed in the contract.

Multiply the penalty with the total number of assets.

Subtract the total penalty from the total payout.
